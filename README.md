# Simple-Color-Image-Retrieval-System
Matlab has been used to run this system. Firstly, a color image histogram function has been computed. An image histogram refers to the probability mass function of the image intensities. This is extended for color images to capture the joint probabilities of the intensities of the three color channels.
Secondly, a database has been created with random images of horses and elephants.
Thirdly, the plots are displayed along with results of ranking of the images based on search.
